## Custom CSS themes for BoardGameArena

BoardGameArena allows you to add your own CSS, so putting together a few themes to use. It seems like a bugged implementation, but here's how I got it to work:

1. Go to Preferences > Advanced
2. Paste your CSS into the textbox
3. Click "Save" - the page refreshes with the CSS not applied, but as plaintext at the top of the page for some reason
4. Click on the link where it says "You can share your custom style with others by pointing them to this URL" - it sends you to the homepage where the CSS is still not applied and is plaintext at the top of the page
5. Do a hard refresh (Shift+Command+R on Mac, Control+F5 on PC) - page should refresh and styles should be applied
